[add to renderer list]
* By using a remote Graphviz render service. (This is experimental!)

= How do I use Graphviz remotely? =

You can also use a remote Graphiz render service with no need to install Graphviz locally. This does however require that your PHP has the *curl* extension loaded.

The plugin caches results locally thus reducing the number of times it needs to generate a new graph; though do note that a logged-in administrator does not use the cache.

This is an experimental service and may be withdrawn at any time. The intention is to make this a *freemium* service, where for no charge you can render graphs but with some sort of mark added to it to indicate use of service. Users can also pay a nominal subscription and have graphs rendered without this mark. At the moment the service will operate in "*free*" mode and ignore any entered API key. Feedback is welcomed on this feature.

= Where do I get an API key for remote rendering? =

At the moment, you can't. This value is currently ignored.
